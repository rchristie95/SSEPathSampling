Transition Path and Interface Sampling of Stochastic Schrödinger Dynamics (2024)
This repository contains code for the research paper "Transition Path and Interface Sampling of Stochastic Schrödinger Dynamics (2024)".

Installation and Setup
Clone or download this repository to a directory in MATLAB.
Ensure you have the Parallel Computing Toolbox installed. This toolbox is required for parfor loops.
If you do not have access to the toolbox, you can replace parfor loops with for loops to run the code in serial.
Requirements
MATLAB: Make sure MATLAB is installed.
Parallel Computing Toolbox: Required for efficient parallel computations. Without this toolbox, code performance may be slower.
Usage
Download the Repository: Clone this repo using:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/rchristie95/SSEPathSampling.git
